description: Hunt server-side template injection (SSTI) across Jinja2 (Flask/Django), Twig (Symfony), Freemarker (Java), ERB (Rails), Spring, Velocity, Mako, Thymeleaf, Smarty. Detection probes use double-curly and dollar-curly math expressions evaluated server-side. Once an engine is fingerprinted, escalate to RCE via the engine-specific class-walker, callback-registrar, or Execute-utility patterns documented in disclosed reports. Detection patterns: error messages reveal engine, blank or numeric eval reveals expression mode. Targets: email templates, PDF/report generators, CMS preview features, error pages with user input. Use when hunting RCE via template rendering, when content shows engine fingerprints, when finding endpoints that compose strings with user input before render.

# hunt-ssti

## Purpose
Adapted from the public Claude-BugHunter capability catalog for CyberStrike's signal-driven skill system.

## Trigger
Hunt server-side template injection (SSTI) across Jinja2 (Flask/Django), Twig (Symfony), Freemarker (Java), ERB (Rails), Spring, Velocity, Mako, Thymeleaf, Smarty. Detection probes use double-curly and dollar-curly math expressions evaluated server-side. Once an engine is fingerprinted, escalate to RCE via the engine-specific class-walker, callback-registrar, or Execute-utility patterns documented in disclosed reports. Detection patterns: error messages reveal engine, blank or numeric eval reveals expression mode. Targets: email templates, PDF/report generators, CMS preview features, error pages with user input. Use when hunting RCE via template rendering, when content shows engine fingerprints, when finding endpoints that compose strings with user input before render.

## Workflow
1. Confirm authorization and scope before testing.
2. Identify the concrete signal that triggered this capability.
3. Form a testable hypothesis from observed behavior, code, traffic, or technology fingerprints.
4. Validate with the least-invasive reproducible test needed to establish the security boundary failure.
5. Correlate related requests, responses, client code, identity state, and infrastructure when the issue crosses layers.
6. Preserve reproducible evidence and route confirmed chains to the relevant validation/reporting skill.

## False-Positive Gate
A scanner alert, reflection, exposed endpoint, version string, or suspicious code pattern is not sufficient by itself. Require a reproducible behavior and demonstrated security impact before treating the result as a finding.

## Routing
Load this skill when its signal is stronger than generic scanning. Combine with another skill only when there is a concrete chain or shared data flow. Record useful negative results and confirmed observations in the learning layer.

## Safety
Use only on authorized targets. Prefer test accounts and synthetic data; avoid destructive actions, unnecessary access to third-party data, credential abuse, persistence, or disruption.
