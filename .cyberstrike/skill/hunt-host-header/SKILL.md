description: Hunt Host Header Injection — password reset poisoning → ATO, web cache poisoning via unkeyed Host/X-Forwarded-Host, routing-based SSRF (Host picks upstream → cloud metadata/internal services), path-override SSRF/ACL-bypass (X-Original-URL/X-Rewrite-URL), OAuth redirect_uri/issuer poisoning, and absolute-URL link poisoning in emails. High to Critical when it reaches ATO or mass cache poisoning. Built on public Host-header research (PortSwigger 'Practical web cache poisoning' + James Kettle, and the classic password-reset-poisoning class). Use on any forgot-password flow, CDN/reverse-proxy-fronted app, OAuth/OIDC endpoint, or absolute-URL-in-email feature.

# hunt-host-header

## Purpose
Adapted from the public Claude-BugHunter capability catalog for CyberStrike's signal-driven skill system.

## Trigger
Hunt Host Header Injection — password reset poisoning → ATO, web cache poisoning via unkeyed Host/X-Forwarded-Host, routing-based SSRF (Host picks upstream → cloud metadata/internal services), path-override SSRF/ACL-bypass (X-Original-URL/X-Rewrite-URL), OAuth redirect_uri/issuer poisoning, and absolute-URL link poisoning in emails. High to Critical when it reaches ATO or mass cache poisoning. Built on public Host-header research (PortSwigger 'Practical web cache poisoning' + James Kettle, and the classic password-reset-poisoning class). Use on any forgot-password flow, CDN/reverse-proxy-fronted app, OAuth/OIDC endpoint, or absolute-URL-in-email feature.

## Workflow
1. Confirm authorization and scope before testing.
2. Identify the concrete signal that triggered this capability.
3. Form a testable hypothesis from observed behavior, code, traffic, or technology fingerprints.
4. Validate with the least-invasive reproducible test needed to establish the security boundary failure.
5. Correlate related requests, responses, client code, identity state, and infrastructure when the issue crosses layers.
6. Preserve reproducible evidence and route confirmed chains to the relevant validation/reporting skill.

## False-Positive Gate
A scanner alert, reflection, exposed endpoint, version string, or suspicious code pattern is not sufficient by itself. Require a reproducible behavior and demonstrated security impact before treating the result as a finding.

## Routing
Load this skill when its signal is stronger than generic scanning. Combine with another skill only when there is a concrete chain or shared data flow. Record useful negative results and confirmed observations in the learning layer.

## Safety
Use only on authorized targets. Prefer test accounts and synthetic data; avoid destructive actions, unnecessary access to third-party data, credential abuse, persistence, or disruption.
