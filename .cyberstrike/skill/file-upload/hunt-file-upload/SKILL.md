description: Hunt file upload bugs — RCE via webshell, XSS via SVG/HTML, SSRF via XXE in DOCX, path traversal via filename. Bypass tables (10 techniques): double extension (shell.php.jpg if server checks last ext only), magic bytes spoofing (PNG header on PHP), null byte (shell.php\0.jpg), case (PHP, .Php, .pHP), .htaccess upload to enable execution, SVG with <script>, HTML/SVG XSS, DOCX with embedded XXE, ZIP slip (../../../etc/passwd in archive), polyglot files. Detection: any /upload, /avatar, /profile-picture, /attachment, /import endpoint. Test: upload PHP/JSP/ASPX shells, request via direct URL, check response. Validate: actual code execution (whoami output) for RCE; reflected XSS in profile-photo URL. Use when testing file upload features, avatar/attachment endpoints, import/export functions, XML/DOCX/ZIP processors. Real paid examples.

# hunt-file-upload

## Purpose
Adapted from the public Claude-BugHunter capability catalog for CyberStrike's signal-driven skill system.

## Trigger
Hunt file upload bugs — RCE via webshell, XSS via SVG/HTML, SSRF via XXE in DOCX, path traversal via filename. Bypass tables (10 techniques): double extension (shell.php.jpg if server checks last ext only), magic bytes spoofing (PNG header on PHP), null byte (shell.php\0.jpg), case (PHP, .Php, .pHP), .htaccess upload to enable execution, SVG with <script>, HTML/SVG XSS, DOCX with embedded XXE, ZIP slip (../../../etc/passwd in archive), polyglot files. Detection: any /upload, /avatar, /profile-picture, /attachment, /import endpoint. Test: upload PHP/JSP/ASPX shells, request via direct URL, check response. Validate: actual code execution (whoami output) for RCE; reflected XSS in profile-photo URL. Use when testing file upload features, avatar/attachment endpoints, import/export functions, XML/DOCX/ZIP processors. Real paid examples.

## Workflow
1. Confirm authorization and scope before testing.
2. Identify the concrete signal that triggered this capability.
3. Form a testable hypothesis from observed behavior, code, traffic, or technology fingerprints.
4. Validate with the least-invasive reproducible test needed to establish the security boundary failure.
5. Correlate related requests, responses, client code, identity state, and infrastructure when the issue crosses layers.
6. Preserve reproducible evidence and route confirmed chains to the relevant validation/reporting skill.

## False-Positive Gate
A scanner alert, reflection, exposed endpoint, version string, or suspicious code pattern is not sufficient by itself. Require a reproducible behavior and demonstrated security impact before treating the result as a finding.

## Routing
Load this skill when its signal is stronger than generic scanning. Combine with another skill only when there is a concrete chain or shared data flow. Record useful negative results and confirmed observations in the learning layer.

## Safety
Use only on authorized targets. Prefer test accounts and synthetic data; avoid destructive actions, unnecessary access to third-party data, credential abuse, persistence, or disruption.
